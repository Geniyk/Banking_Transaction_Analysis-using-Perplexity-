## Problem Statement:

This dashboard helps banking analysts and financial institutions understand customer behavior, account activity, and transactional trends more effectively. Using a relational SQL Server dataset integrated with Power BI, the report tracks account balances, transaction types, high-value outliers, inactive customers, and demographic insights to help detect anomalies, improve customer engagement, and monitor financial health across customer segments.

The dataset includes over 10,000 transactions, embedded with intentional data quality issues (mixed date formats, nulls, duplicates, inconsistent text casing, and foreign key mismatches) to simulate real-world messy datasets. This enables users to practice data cleaning and transformation using Power Query Editor.

The Power BI dashboard spans two pages, each showing 5 actionable KPIs to support decision-making on financial performance, customer management, and fraud detection.


### Steps followed:

- Step 1 : Generated a banking dataset using Perplexity AI by providing a detailed prompt.
The dataset included the following tables with ~10,000 records and intentional data quality issues:

- Customers
- Accounts
- Transactions
- Data issues introduced:
(a) Null values in columns like Email, Description

(b) Duplicate rows

(c) Mixed casing in text fields

(d) Inconsistent date formats

(e) Trailing spaces in City and Name columns

- Step 2 : Executed SQL queries from Perplexity to create and populate the tables inside SQL Server using Power_BI2 database.

- step 3: Connected Power BI Desktop to SQL Server database via "Get Data" â†’ SQL Server â†’ Connected to Power_BI2 and imported the 3 tables.

- step 4: Opened Power Query Editor in Power BI and enabled:

(a) Column Distribution

(b) Column Quality

(c) Column Profile

Also changed data profiling from 1000 rows to Entire Dataset for accurate insights.

- Step 5 : Cleaned the data using Power Query transformations:

(a) Removed duplicates

(b) Standardized date formats

(c) Trimmed text fields (Name, City)

(d) Replaced null values in Email with "Not Provided"

(e) Formatted mixed casing using Text.Proper()

- step 6:  Verified table relationships:

(a) Customers[CustomerID] â†’ Accounts[CustomerID]

(b) Accounts[AccountID] â†’ Transactions[AccountID]

- step 7: Created 2 Power BI Report Pages:

(a) Page 1: Account & Customer Overview

(b) Page 2: Transaction Insights

## ðŸ”¹ Page 1: Banking KPIs & Trends

- step 8: Measures Table was created:
(a) Transactions Count

Following DAX expression was written for the same,
Transactions Count = COUNT(CombinedBankingDataset[TransactionID])

(b) Monthly Transaction Amount

Following DAX expression was written for the same,
Monthly Transaction Amount = CALCULATE(SUM(CombinedBankingDataset[Amount]), ALLEXCEPT(CombinedBankingDataset, CombinedBankingDataset[TransactionDate].[Month]))

(c) Total Balance

Following DAX expression was written for the same,
Total Balance = SUM(CombinedBankingDataset[Balance])

(d) Inactive Accounts

Following DAX expression was written for the same,
Inactive Accounts = CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT(CombinedBankingDataset[Account_AccountID]), FILTER(VALUES(CombinedBankingDataset[Account_AccountID]), CALCULATE(MAX(CombinedBankingDataset[TransactionDate])) < TODAY()-90))

(e) Average Balance

Following DAX expression was written for the same,
Average Balance = AVERAGE(CombinedBankingDataset[Balance])

## ðŸ”¹ Page 2: Customer & Account Demographics
- step 9: Measures Table was created:
(a) Customer Count by Gender

Following DAX expression was written for the same,
Customer Count by Gender = DISTINCTCOUNT(CombinedBankingDataset[CustomerID])

(b) Account Count by Type

Following DAX expression was written for the same,
Account Count by Type = COUNT(CombinedBankingDataset[Account_AccountID])

(c) Monthly Transaction Balance

Following DAX expression was written for the same,
Monthly Transaction Balance = CALCULATE(SUM(CombinedBankingDataset[Balance]), ALLEXCEPT(CombinedBankingDataset, CombinedBankingDataset[TransactionDate].[Month]))


- step 10: New Columns were added in CombinedBankingDataset to determine Number of Customers by Age-group.

(a) Customer Age

Following DAX expression was written for the same,
Customer Age = DATEDIFF(CombinedBankingDataset[DateOfBirth], TODAY(), YEAR)


(b) Customer Age Group

Following DAX expression was written for the same,
Customer Age Group = SWITCH(TRUE(), [Customer Age]<=25, "<=25", [Customer Age]<=35, "26-35", [Customer Age]<=50,"36-50","51+")
